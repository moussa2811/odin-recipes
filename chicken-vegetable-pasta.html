        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken, vegetables and pasta make up this filling salad which everyone seems to like, even people who don't like pasta salad. This is great for hot summer days when you just don't feel like turning on the oven. Note: the amounts here are estimates, as I rarely measure when I make this salad, so feel free to add a bit more or less of whatever you please.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup seashell pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped, cooked chicken meat</li>
            <li>3 green onions, chopped into 1 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>⅔ cup Italian-style salad dressing</li>
            <li>¼ cup sunflower seeds (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente, rinse under cold water and drain.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the pasta, chicken, green onions, bell pepper, olives and cucumber.</li>
            <li>Pour dressing over salad and toss to coat. Chill for 2 hours before serving; sprinkle with sunflower seeds if desired.</li>
         </ol>
